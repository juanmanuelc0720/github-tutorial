## Git vs. GitHub
The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is an open source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.

## Initial Setup
To make a github account you just go to github.com and click on sign-up and give the info they ask.
[IDE is where you go and write the codes to push to your github account](github.com/hstatsep/ide50)

## Repository Setup
First you have to initialize by using **git init**
Then you have to make a README.md by using **touch** then the name of the file and use c9 to open it and type your stuff
Then you have to save by using **Command S**
Then you add the file to the file you are in by using **git add**
Then you have to commit but by using **git commit -m "_blank_"**
After you have to push it back to your account by using **git push**
Lastly you go to your github and refresh
